This projects aims to provide authentication by using ssh keys.

Most infrastructures I've managed have had bits of single-sign-on mixed
not-so-single-sign-on. Further, the first thing I disable in sshd is always
password authentication and make sure everyone gets an ssh key and knows
how to use it.

I like ssh keys. They're simple. On my infrastructure, they're everywhere. It's
how you log in.

With tools like mcollective, openvpn, etc, you often need a way to authorize
and authenticate users. With OpenVPN you can use passwords or SSL certs.
Managing my own SSL CA is not my idea of a good time, but is often required
for some things. Further, teaching engineers how to use SSH with keys is hard
enough without saying "oh, here's another authentication scheme with your SSL
cert."

Add PGP to the mix, and you've got big frownyface - from me, anyway.

The point of writing this module was to allow authentication of messages from
specific users over mcollective. The goal is to be able to use keys in your
ssh-agent and sign messages - having them verified on the remote end by using
your own user's authorized_keys file.
